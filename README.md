Pareto4D.m creates a 4-dimensional (i.e., x,y,z,w) representation where 'x' and 'y' are plotted on the primary axes, the dimension of the circles is proportional to 'z' and the colors represent 'w'. Examples can be found in Castelletti et al. (2013).

tuples_shuffling.m performs a random shuffling of the tuples (rows) of the input dataset. This operation has been demonstrated to enhance the performance of the Iterative Input Selection algorithm (Galelli and Castelletti, 2013).
